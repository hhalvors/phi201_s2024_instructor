Today we cover three things: (1) meta-rules for proofs, (2) relating
proofs to truth tables, and (3) review for midterm exam.

# Meta-rules for proofs

## Substitution



## Cut



## Replacement




## Liberal proofs 






# Relating proofs and truth tables 

**Soundness theorem:** If there is a proof of the sequent $A_1,\dots
,A_n\vdash B$, then the corresponding argument is valid. That is, for
any row in their joint truth table, if all of $A_1,\dots ,A_n$ are
true, then $B$ is also true.

*What it means in practice:* If there is a way for all of $A_1,\dots
,A_n$ to be true and $B$ false, then there is no proof of $B$ from
$A_1,\dots ,A_n$. (No correctly written proof with end with $B$ on the
main line, and dependencies $A_1,\dots ,A_n$.)

**Completeness theorem:**

*What it means in practice:*

**Exercise:** Explain how you know that the following is not a good
proof strategy:

**Exercise:** Can there be a correctly written proof with the
following lines? Explain your answer by reference to 

# Review for midterm exam
