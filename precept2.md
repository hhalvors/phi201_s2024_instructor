# Introduction 

This week finds us in the thick of things with learning how to write
formal proofs. The main new complication is the use of dependency
numbers, and the primary focus of today's precept is developing your
familiarity and proficiency with this kind of thinking. The biggest
challenge, without a doubt, is the rule of or elimination. In fact, it
is the most complicated inference rule that we will learn all
semester.

We will also do a bit more translation work in order to draw on the
intuitions that you already have from using logic with natural
language.

# Old proof rules in new form

Let's first see how to use our old rules (from last week) while
incorporating the use of dependency numbers.



# New proof rules 

## Conditional proof



## Or elimination

**Exercise** Which of the following proofs with or-elimination is
correct? If a proof is not correct, explain what is wrong with it, and
say whether there is a simple fix, or whether it is fatally flawed.





## Eliminating all dependency numbers
