With the introduction of the RAA rule, we now have a complete set of
inference rules for propositional logic. In this precept we will first
focus on proofs that using RAA. We will then "open the floodgates" for
all possible kinds of proofs, using all of the different rules. In
many situations, it may not be immediately clear which rules will be
needed to get you to the destination --- and this is a crucial way in
which "proving" differs from following an algorithm. What you will
need to do is to develop a good sense of strategy, and the only way to
do that is through *practice*.
