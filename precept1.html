<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>We have to start this course relatively quickly, which means that the
first precept will cover both general concepts, and the first steps into
our formal system of logic. At the end of this week, you should be
comfortable with the various symbols <span
class="math inline">∨,∧,→,¬</span> and how they work to build more
complex sentences. You should also be comfortable writing simple proofs
that involve the intro and elim rules for <span
class="math inline">∧</span>, the intro rule for <span
class="math inline">∨</span>, modus ponens, and modus tollens.</p>
<p>The first part of the precept is primarily qualitative: we take
concepts and words that you already use, and we formulate some more
precise definitions. We don’t think that we necessarily have the “right”
definitions of these concepts, or that everyone understands these
concepts in exactly the same way. You might rather think of what we are
doing as establishing conventions for a fruitful discussion.</p>
<h1 id="general-concepts">General concepts</h1>
<h2 id="argument-identification">Argument identification</h2>
<p>For each of the following paragraphs: (a) State whether or not that
paragraph contains an argument. (Note: by saying that something is an
<em>argument</em> is not saying that it is a <em>good</em> argument.)
(b) If there’s an argument, identify its conclusion and premises. (c) If
there’s no argument, explain what’s lacking.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Professor Plum was in the drawing room. Miss Scarlet was in the
kitchen. The murderer used the knife and the evil act was committed in
the hall.</p></li>
<li><p>If Professor Plum was in the drawing room then Colonel Mustard
was the murderer. Professor Plum was in the drawing room. So, Colonel
Mustard was the murderer.</p></li>
<li><p>Every student of logic is wise and knowledgeable. Anyone
attempting this exercise is a student of logic. Therefore, anyone
attempting this exercise is wise and knowledgeable.</p></li>
<li><p>I am absolutely sick and tired of getting wet every time it
rains. From now on I will never forget to take my umbrella with me in
the morning. Even if the weather looks fine when I leave I will
certainly make a point of taking that umbrella.</p></li>
<li><p>All human beings are mortal. So, it stands to reason that
Socrates is mortal. After all, he is a human being.</p></li>
<li><p>Professor Plum was obviously the murderer in this instance. For
the murderer used the knife and Professor Plum had the knife. And the
murder was committed in the hall and Professor Plum was in the
hall.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="charitable-reading">Charitable reading</h2>
<p>I real life, the form of an argument can be hidden by various
rhetorical strategies, or simply because it is assumed that all parties
would agree to some premise (and so that premise is not stated
explicitly). What this means is that a good argument analysis will often
involve some charitable re-interpretation of the precise text that you
have in front of you.</p>
<h2 id="short-answer">Short answer</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What are the components of an argument?</p></li>
<li><p>Which kinds of sentences can be premises or conclusions of an
argument?</p></li>
<li><p>Is a valid argument necessarily a “good” argument? What might a
good argument have that a valid argument doesn’t?</p></li>
<li><p>What’s the point of studying the validity of arguments, as
opposed to their goodness?</p></li>
<li><p>If an argument has true premises and a true conclusion, then is
it valid?</p></li>
<li><p>If you disagree with the conclusion of an argument, might you
still say that it’s a valid argument?</p></li>
<li><p>According to the definitions given in lecture, which of the
following sentences makes sense, and which do not?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>That’s a true argument.</p></li>
<li><p>That’s a true statement.</p></li>
<li><p>That’s a valid point.</p></li>
<li><p>That’s a valid argument.</p></li>
<li><p>That’s a valid reason.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Give an example of a valid argument with false premises and a
true conclusion.</p></li>
<li><p>Give an example of an invalid argument with true premises and a
true conclusion.</p></li>
<li><p>True or False. Discuss.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>If an argument is valid, then you might be able to make it
invalid by adding further premises.</p></li>
<li><p>You can make an invalid argument valid by removing
premises.</p></li>
<li><p>If a sentence doesn’t follow from another, then its denial
must.</p></li>

</ol>
<h1 id="first-steps-in-proving-with-complete-rigor">First steps in
proving with complete rigor</h1>
<h1 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h1>
<p>One might imagine the complete process of argument evaluation as
follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Translate the argument from natural language into symbolic
form.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that the argument is valid. Or show that it is invalid –
something that we don’t yet know how to do.</p></li>
<li><p>Pass judgment on the original argument.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Nobody really ever does that, and the process would also have several
pitfalls. One of the main pitfalls is the “false negative”, i.e. the
symbolic argument is invalid, but the original argument is valid. In
fact, there are good reasons to think that no rigorous symbolic system
could ever capture all the ways in which a natural language argument
could be valid. So, in the first place, take that as a caution about the
range of our methods.</p>
<p>However, it can still be helpful practice to complete the process
described above. The hope is that with sufficient practice, you will
more quickly see the logical structure behind arguments you encounter in
real life.</p>
<p>Let’s undertake the process on a few arguments.</p>
<p><strong>Argument 1</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If Donald Trump wins the upcoming election, then certain policies
detrimental to international relations will be implemented.</p></li>
<li><p>If certain policies detrimental to international relations are
implemented, there will be an increase in domestic social
unrest.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, if Donald Trump wins the upcoming election, there will
be an increase in domestic social unrest.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Argument 2</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Universities should encourage diverse viewpoints and free speech
is essential for exposing students to diverse viewpoints.</p></li>
<li><p>If free speech is essential for exposing students to diverse
viewpoints, then universities should have policies that protect free
speech.</p></li>
<li><p>Universities should foster a respectful environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Universities should have policies that protect free speech and
foster a respectful environment.</p></li>
