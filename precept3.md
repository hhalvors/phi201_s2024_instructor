With the introduction of the RAA rule, we now have a "complete" set of
inference rules for propositional logic. (We will explain in a couple
of weeks what exactly we mean by "complete" in this sentence.) In this
precept we will first focus on proofs that using RAA. We will then
"open the floodgates" for all possible kinds of proofs, using all of
the different rules. In many situations, it may not be immediately
clear which rules will be needed to get you to the destination --- and
this is a crucial way in which "proving" differs from following an
algorithm. What you will need to do is to develop a good sense of
strategy, and the only way to do that is through *practice*.

Never give up
