With the introduction of the RAA rule, we now have a "complete" set of
inference rules for propositional logic. (We will explain in a couple
of weeks what exactly "complete" means in this sentence.) In this
precept we will first focus on proofs that using RAA. We will then
open the floodgates for all possible kinds of proofs, using all of the
different rules. In many cases, it will not be immediately clear which
rules you need to get you to the destination --- and this is a crucial
way in which finding a proof differs from following an algorithm. (At
no stage in writing a proof are you forced to make the next move. It
is up to you to decide which move is most likely to get you to the
goal.) What you will need to do is to develop a good sense of
strategy, and the best way to develop that sense is through practice. 

# Proofs with RAA


# More proofs

<!-- briding the gap with other proofs you've already done -->
